                        <tr><td>20</td>     <td>BSTMON</td>      <td>Overvoltage Threshold-Adjust Input. Connect a resistor-divider from the switching converter output to BSTMON and GND. The OVP comparator reference is internally set to 1.23V.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>21</td>     <td>PGND</td>        <td>Power Ground. PGND is the switching current-return-path connection. Connect GND, LEDGND, and PGND at a single point.</td></tr>

EN has an internal clamp at 3.9V; when EN is above this voltage, an input current of (VEN - 3.9V)/1.2MΩ will flow. Do not take EN low if I2C communication is needed on a shared I2C bus.</td></tr>
